This is a simple implementation of the COVID SIR Model. Credit various online sources the implementation of this.
Part of this excercise has been to also improve my understanding of git. This purely an excercise for self development. 

The model divides the population N into three categories:
  - Susceptible but not yet Infected 
  - Infected 
  - Recovered individuals who now have immunity 

Individuals migrate from Susceptible to Infected then from Infected to Recovered in a system of differential equations.
